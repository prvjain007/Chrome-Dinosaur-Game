# Chrome-Dinosaur-Game
When your internet is disconnected you may have come across the game in which a dinosaur runs and crosses the hurdles by jumping, if you will carefully observe it isn't the dinosaur running the background of the dinosaur is changing while the dinosaur is stationary.

This code has some bugs as of now and you would need to download processing.org in order to run this code.
